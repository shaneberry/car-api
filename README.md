# Car API sample project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ogli-api/car-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ogli-api/car-api)

This is a Car API sample application written in Python.

## Environment

As a dependency manager for this project we are using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To install it, please check [this](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) link. To check that Pipenv is installed just run:

```
$ pipenv --version
```

### Install dependencies

To create a new python virtual environment and install all the necessary dependencies there, just run the following command:

```
$ pipenv install
```

To activate this project's virtualenv, run `pipenv shell`. If you want to desactivate the virtualenv, just perform `deactivate`. Pipenv creates all your virtual environments in a default location.

## Run the project

To run the project locally we can run the following command:

```
$ pipenv run python app.py
```

Then, your Flask docker server instance will be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

The swagger Car API will be running on [http://localhost:5000/ui](http://localhost:5000/ui).

## Makefile commands

There is a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#toc-An-Introduction-to-Makefiles) that provide us an easy way to run different action around the project. You just need to run:

```
$ make <action>
```

All the supported actions are (you can see the list running `$ make help`):

| Action      | Description                                              |

| lint        | check style with flake8                                  |
| test        | run tests quickly with the default Python                |
| test-all    | run tests on every Python version with tox               |
| coverage    | check code coverage quickly with the default Python      |

| servedocs   | compile the docs watching for changes                    |
| release     | package and upload a release                             |
| dist        | builds source and wheel package                          |
| install     | install the package to the active Python's site-packages |
| develop     | install the package as develop                           |
| uninstall   | uninstall the package                                    |

## Swagger API Definition

Please execute the following commands to run the Editor in your local machine from Docker.

```
$ docker pull swaggerapi/swagger-editor
$ docker run -p 8085:8080 -e SWAGGER_JSON=/tmp/swagger.yml -v `pwd`:/tmp swaggerapi/swagger-ui
```

This will run Swagger Editor (in detached mode) on port 8085 on your machine, so you can open it by navigating to [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085) in your browser.
